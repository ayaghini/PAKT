# Product brief

## One‑sentence
A pocket APRS tracker + message TNC for 2m that pairs to a phone over BLE, eliminating audio cables and manual level tuning.

## Target user
- Hams who want APRS position + basic messaging with a modern phone UI.
- Hams who want a reliable “packet modem” they can use with a phone at events, hikes, or in vehicles.

## Core value proposition
- Phone provides map + UX
- Device provides RF, GPS, and reliable real‑time packet processing
- No audio cables, no VOX hacks, no “which sound device?” troubleshooting

## Constraints
- 2m APRS 1200 AFSK, AX.25 UI frames
- Small, battery powered
- BLE-first for phone connectivity
- Configurable for regional APRS frequency plans

## Non-goals (MVP)
- Digipeater / iGate (optional later)
- Full KISS TNC compatibility (can be added later)
- High-power RF stages (keep within SA818 characteristics in MVP)
